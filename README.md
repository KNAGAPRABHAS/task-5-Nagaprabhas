# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

## 🔍 Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a given dataset to uncover insights, visualize relationships, and summarize key statistics using Python libraries like **Pandas**, **Seaborn**, and **Matplotlib**.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📌 EDA Steps Covered

### a. Basic Exploration
- Used `.info()` and `.describe()` for data overview.
- Used `.value_counts()` to explore categorical and low-cardinality columns.

### b. Visualizations
- `sns.pairplot()` to view pairwise relationships between features.
- `sns.heatmap()` for correlation matrix analysis.

### c. Relationships & Trends
- Identified correlated features.
- Highlighted predictive trends based on feature interactions.

### d. Distribution Analysis
- **Histograms** to view value distribution.
- **Boxplots** to detect outliers.
- **Scatterplots** to assess trends with the target variable.

## 📈 Key Observations

| Visual         | Observations                                                                 |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `.describe()`  | Summarized key stats for each column.                                         |
| `value_counts()` | Helped understand categorical/low-unique columns.                           |
| `pairplot()`   | Showed strong pairwise correlations and potential linear relationships.       |
| `heatmap()`    | Revealed multicollinearity between some features.                            |
| `histograms`   | Uncovered skewed distributions.                                               |
| `boxplots`     | Exposed features with significant outliers.                                  |
| `scatterplots` | Identified key predictors based on trends with the target.                   |

## 📌 Summary of Findings
- Dataset is primarily numeric, with a few features showing high correlation.
- Some features are skewed and may require transformation.
- Outliers exist in several columns.
- Strong relationships between certain features and the target suggest good predictive potential.
- Recommended next steps: feature scaling, outlier handling, and model training.
